👋 Hello! I'm İlayda Yıldız, a Full Stack Developer with professional training in software development and a focus on goals.

Driven by my passion for technology and fueled by my love and curiosity for software development, I dedicate myself to continuous improvement every day. Working on various projects using C#, .NET, and other modern technologies, I closely follow the latest developments in the software world and consistently update my knowledge and skills.

🔧 Experiences and Points of Intersection with Technology:

I worked on the Restoration Project of Selimiye Mosque. This experience was a significant step for me at the intersection of architecture and computing. I participated in a start-up project developed for construction site management at Selimiye Mosque. Being involved in this project not only enriched my approach to architecture and construction processes but also allowed me to explore the potential of software in this field.

Later, while working at KA Partners Architecture, I had the opportunity to focus on digital and parametric design processes, collaborating with my teammates on projects. These experiences directed me towards more IT-related tasks and encouraged me to develop myself in this field. The Bilge Adam Boost training I took to develop myself in this field provided me with a broad perspective on IT. Thanks to this training and the projects I have undertaken, I believe I can effectively manage any type of work.

🔗 How About Connecting:
I thoroughly enjoy communicating with everyone involved in the world of software and sharing knowledge. If you share our passion for technology or have thoughts on potential collaborations, feel free to reach out to me!
